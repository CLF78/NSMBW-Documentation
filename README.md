# NSMBW-Documentation
Documentation on data structures and class definitions used in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The files are currently not compiler-ready, but will be at some point.

Note: All addresses found in the files are for the PAL v1 version of the game.

Credits go to Ninji for doing most of the RE work and to Grop for keeping my idiocy in check. Other credits are mentioned where due.
